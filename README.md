# Things I've learnt at General Assembly (Web Development Intensive)
## Day 1 / 2
* parseInt() for prompt() to eliminate any unwanted string concatenation for number values.
* Pressing cancel on a prompt() generates a NUll value.
* Need to work on 'cleaner' coding - **VARIABLE ALL THE THINGS**. 
>Things were slow - but the assignment was fun.

## Day 3
* indexOf() used for string comparison. Note: return position of first instance found / meaning it can return '0' which is 'falsy'. Implement !== -1 to allow all search entries to go through.
* Look at other students pull requests and improved own code (assigining nested objects to variables to shorten code)
>Feeling good :)
