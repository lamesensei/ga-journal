# Things I've learnt at General Assembly
###*Web Development Intensive*
### Day 1 / 2
* parseInt() for prompt() to eliminate any unwanted string concatenation for number values.
* Pressing cancel on a prompt() generates a NUll value.
* Need to work on 'cleaner' coding - **VARIABLE ALL THE THINGS**.
>Things were slow - but the assignment was fun.

### Day 3
* indexOf() used for string comparison. Note: return position of first instance found / meaning it can return '0' which is 'falsy'. Implement !== -1 to allow all search entries to go through.
* Look at other students pull requests and improved own code (assigning nested objects to variables to shorten code)
>Feeling good :)

### Day 4
* head -n 5 for printing specific lines of files in terminal
* switch case for multiple similar if/else conditionals

### Day 5
* setTimeout(function,1000) wrong vs setTimeout(function(),1000) right
* Function callbacks always involve the **function** and not its return value!

### Day 6/7
* Need to plan / pseudo code before starting.
* Focus on requirements.
>Assignment was fun but lost track creating function after function...
